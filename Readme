Templated Linked List Project Written in C++

Overview:

    This project provides a templated implementation of a linked list in C++. Derived from academic coursework and extensively customized for enhanced functionality.

Refrences: 
    N/A

Features
    Dynamic memory allocation for nodes
    Open object support. 
Operations:
    ~ Append: Add an element to the end of the list
    ~ Insert: Insert an element at a specified position
    ~ Remove: Remove an element from a specified position
    ~ Find: Find the position of a specified element
    ~ Max and Min: Find the maximum and minimum values in the list
    ~ Fullprint: Print the entire linked list
    ~ Other utility functions
Requirements
    C++ Compiler
    Google Test (for testing) (Optional) (Self provided)

Under Construction:
    - Circle Linked List support.
    - Min() and Max(): Proper implementation
    - Find(): requires more safeguards
    - Fullprint(): more intuitive
    - _RepairMan(): if an error or a flaw is detected, it will catch the error and attempt to find where the problem is, and if all memory is recoverable, then it recovers it.
    - TestBrick(): Moved to individual Project
