# Linked List Project

## by: Thomas Dowd

### Overview

This project is based on various assignments requiring dynamic memory storage in C++.
### 1. Polymorphic Linked List

The better, more refined take on dynamic memory storage in c++. the best representation I can create of a true linked list, showcasing my programming ability.

##### Features:
* Inheritance based polymorphic linked list.
* Dynamic memory allocation and stack allocation.
* User created and default object support.
* Simple elegant framework that can be easily installed anywhere.

### 2. Templated Linked List

A simple, yet resilient form of the linked list. It was the initial attempt, meaning it is a bit rough around the edges, though it will get the job done.

#### Features:
* Dynamic memory allocation for nodes.
* Open object support.
* Variety of functions.

## Requirements
- C++ Compiler

## Under Construction:
- Circle Linked List support.
- Find(): requires more safeguards
- Fullprint(): more intuitive
